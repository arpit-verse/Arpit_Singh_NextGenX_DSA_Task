## Project Overview

The objective of this submission is to demonstrate **strong foundational understanding of DSA concepts**, clean implementation, and robustness against invalid inputs.  
All solutions are implemented **from scratch in Java**, without using built-in shortcut libraries.

Special emphasis has been placed on:
- Core algorithmic logic
- Defensive programming and input validation
- Readable and maintainable code structure

---

## Implemented Problems

### 1. Frequency Counter
- Counts the frequency of input elements
- Supports **strings, numbers, and special characters**
- Uses **comparison-based sorting** followed by linear traversal
- Includes robust input validation

### 2. Custom Stack Implementation
- Array-based stack implementation
- Supports Push, Pop, Peek, and IsEmpty operations
- Explicit handling of **overflow and underflow**
- Accepts **string-based input**, making it generic

### 3. Longest Unique Substring
- Implements the **sliding window technique**
- Computes the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
- Efficient **O(n)** time complexity
